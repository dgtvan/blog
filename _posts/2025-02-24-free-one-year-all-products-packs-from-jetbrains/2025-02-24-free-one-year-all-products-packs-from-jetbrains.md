Two years ago, I discovered Rider and other JetBrains products. My experience with them was very positive, so I continued supporting the company by participating in surveys and providing feedback.

Recently, I was selected to participate in a research study called User Diary, where I share my experiences while using Rider. As a token of appreciation, JetBrains rewarded me with a free one-year subscription to the All Products Pack.

It was a rewarding experience in different waysâ€”learning more about Rider and contributing to its improvement ðŸ¤—
